	abstract = {Games console devices have been designed to be an entertainment system. However, the 8th generation games console have new features that can support criminal activities and investigators need to be aware of them. This paper highlights the forensics value of the Microsoft game console Xbox One, the latest version of their Xbox series. The Xbox One game console provides many features including web browsing, social networking, and chat functionality. From a forensic perspective, all those features will be a place of interest in forensic examinations. However, the available published literature focused on examining the physical hard drive artefacts, which are encrypted and cannot provide deep analysis of the user's usage of the console. In this paper, we carried out an investigation of the Xbox One games console by using two approaches: a physical investigation of the hard drive to identify the valuable file timestamp information and logical examination via the graphical user interface. Furthermore, this paper identifies potential valuable forensic data sources within the Xbox One and provides best practices guidance for collecting data in a forensically sound manner.},

	abstract = {Network and information security are of significant and growing economic importance. 
The direct cost to Europe of protective measures and electronic fraud is measured in 
billions of euros; and growing public concerns about information security hinder the development 
of both markets and public services, giving rise to even greater indirect costs. 
 
For example, while writing this report, the UK government confessed to the loss 
of child-benefit records affecting 25 million citizens. Further revelations about losses of 
electronic medical information and of data on children have called into question plans for 
the development of e-health and other systems. 
 
Information security is now a mainstream political issue, and can no longer be considered 
the sole purview of technologists. Fortunately, information security economics has 
recently become a live research topic: as well as collecting data on what fails and how, 
security economists have discovered that systems often fail not for some technical reason, 
but because the incentives were wrong. An appropriate regulatory framework is just as 
important for protecting economic and other activity online as it is offline. 
 
This report sets out to draw, from both economic principles and empirical data, a 
set of recommendations about what information security issues should be handled at the 
Member State level and what issues may require harmonisation – or at least coordination. 
In the report, fifteen key policy proposals are made. A 
consultative meeting was held in December 2007 which established that almost all of these proposals 
had wide stakeholder support and provide a basis for future action 
by ENISA and the European Commission.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of connected computing devices that have the ability to transfer valued data between each other via the Internet without requiring human intervention. In such a connected environment, the social IoT (SIoT) has become an emerging trend where multiple IoT devices owned by users support communication within a social circle. Trust management in the SIoT network is imperative as trusting the information from compromised devices could lead to serious compromises within the network. It is important to have a mechanism where the devices and their users evaluate the trustworthiness of other devices and users before trusting the information sent by them. The privacy preservation, decentralization, and self-enforcing management without involving trusted third parties are the fundamental challenges in designing a trust management system for SIoT. To fulfill these challenges, this article presents a novel framework for computing and updating the trustworthiness of participants in the SIoT network in a self-enforcing manner without relying on any trusted third party. The privacy of the participants in the SIoT is protected by using homomorphic encryption in the decentralized setting. To achieve the properties of self-enforcement, the trust score of each device is automatically updated based on its previous trust score and the up-to-date tally of the votes by its peers in the network with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enforce that every participant follows the protocol honestly. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and present evaluation benchmarks by prototyping the main functionality of the system. The performance results show that the system has a linear increase in computation and communication overheads with more participants in the network. Furthermore, we prove the correctness, privacy, and security of the proposed system under a malicious adversarial model.},

In addition, we must address the problem of storing and mining that data for higher-quality IoT services. Blockchain technology, even in today's nascent form, has the potential to be the foundation for a common, distributed, trustless, and autonomous infrastructure system. This article describes a standardized IoT infrastructure where data are stored on a distributed storage service that is fault-tolerant and resistant to distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks and data access is managed by a decentralized, trustless blockchain. The illustrated system used LoRa as the emerging network technology, Swarm as the distributed data storage platform, and Ethereum as the blockchain platform.

	abstract = {Federated identity management enables users to access multiple systems using a single login credential. However, to achieve this a complex privacy compromising authentication has to occur between the user, relying party (RP) (e.g., a business), and a credential service provider (CSP) that performs the authentication. In this work, we use a smart contract on a blockchain to enable an architecture where authentication no longer involves the CSP. Authentication is performed solely through user to RP communications (eliminating fees and enhancing privacy). No third party needs to be contacted, not even the smart contract. No public key infrastructure (PKI) needs to be maintained. And no revocation lists need to be checked. In contrast to competing smart contract approaches, ours is hierarchically managed (like a PKI) enabling better validation of attribute providers and making it more useful for large entities to provide identity services for their constituents (e.g., a government) while still enabling users to maintain a level of self-sovereignty.},

	abstract = {Best practices for Internet of Things (IoT) security have recently attracted considerable attention worldwide from industry and governments, while academic research has highlighted the failure of many IoT product manufacturers to follow accepted practices. We explore not the failure to follow best practices, but rather a surprising lack of understanding, and void in the literature, on what (generically) "best practice" means, independent of meaningfully identifying specific individual practices. Confusion is evident from guidelines that conflate desired outcomes with security practices to achieve those outcomes. How do best practices, good practices, and standard practices differ? Or guidelines, recommendations, and requirements? Can something be a best practice if it is not actionable? We consider categories of best practices, and how they apply over the lifecycle of IoT devices. For concreteness in our discussion, we analyze and categorize a set of 1014 IoT security best practices, recommendations, and guidelines from industrial, government, and academic sources. As one example result, we find that about 70{\textbackslash}\% of these practices or guidelines relate to early IoT device lifecycle stages, highlighting the critical position of manufacturers in addressing the security issues in question. We hope that our work provides a basis for the community to build on in order to better understand best practices, identify and reach consensus on specific practices, and then find ways to motivate relevant stakeholders to follow them.},

At present, information security is accomplished either through software algorithms or hardware protocols. Software algorithms use pseudo random numbers generated by one-way mathematical functions that are computationally robust in the classical era, but are shown to become vulnerable in the post-quantum era. Hardware security overcomes such limitations through physically unclonable functions (PUFs) that exploit manufacturing process variations in the physical microstructures of Si integrated circuits to obtain true random numbers. However, recent upsurge in reverse engineering strategies make Si-PUFs vulnerable to various attacks. Moreover, Si-PUFs are low-entropy, power-hungry, and area-inefficient. Here we introduce a biological PUF which exploits the inherent randomness found in the colonized populations of T cells and is difficult to reverse engineer and at the same time is high-entropy, non-volatile, reconfigurable, ultra-low-power, low-cost, and environment friendly.},

Using the concept of super-modules (s-modules) built from adjacent spatial multiplexed modules with regular geometrical shapes, assisted by colour multiplexing, we modelled and design a single QR code with, at least, the triple storage capacity of an analogous size black/white QR code, acting as a smart-tag ensuring restrict access and trackability. The s-modules are printed using luminescent low-cost and eco-friendly inks based on organic-inorganic hybrids modified by lanthanides with multiplexed colour emission in the orthogonal RGB space. The access to the restrict information is attained only under UV irradiation and encrypted for secure transmission. The concept of active QR codes for smart trackability and IoT was materialised through the development of a free friendly-user mobile app.},

Counterfeiting medication poses a tremendous threat to patient safety, public health, and the economy in developed and less developed countries. Current solutions are often vulnerable due to the limited security levels. We propose that the highest protection against counterfeit medicines would be a combination of a physically unclonable function (PUF) with on-dose authentication. A PUF can provide a digital fingerprint with multiple pairs of input challenges and output responses. On-dose authentication can verify every individual pill without removing the identification tag. Here, we report on-dose PUFs that can be directly attached onto the surface of medicines, be swallowed, and digested. Fluorescent proteins and silk proteins serve as edible photonic biomaterials and the photoluminescent properties provide parametric support of challenge-response pairs. Such edible cryptographic primitives can play an important role in pharmaceutical anti-counterfeiting and other security applications requiring immediate destruction or vanishing features.},

	abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has brought in new challenges in, device identification --what the device is, and, authentication --is the device the one it claims to be. Traditionally, the authentication problem is solved by means of a cryptographic protocol. However, the computational complexity of cryptographic protocols and/or scalability problems related to key management, render almost all cryptography based authentication protocols impractical for IoT. The problem of device identification is, on the other hand, sadly neglected. We believe that device fingerprinting can be used to solve both these problems effectively. In this work, we present a methodology to perform device behavioral fingerprinting that can be employed to undertake device type identification. A device behavior is approximated using features extracted from the network traffic of the device. These features are used to train a machine learning model that can be used to detect similar device types. We validate our approach using five-fold cross validation; we report a identification rate of 86-99\% and a mean accuracy of 99\%, across all our experiments. Our approach is successful even when a device uses encrypted communication. Furthermore, we show preliminary results for fingerprinting device categories, i.e., identifying different device types having similar functionality.},

Our analysis reveals invasive practices such as inserting invisible login forms to trigger autoﬁlling of the saved user credentials, and reading and exﬁltrating social network data when the user logs in via Facebook login. Further, we uncovered password, credit card, and health data leaks to third parties due to wholesale collection of the DOM.

OTT devices offer an alternative to multi-channel television subscription services, and are often monetized through behavioral advertising. To shed light on the privacy practices of such platforms, we developed a system that can automatically download OTT apps (also known as channels), and interact with them while intercepting the network traffic and performing best-effort TLS interception. We used this smart crawler to visit more than 2,000 channels on two popular OTT platforms, namely Roku and Amazon Fire TV. Our results show that tracking is pervasive on both OTT platforms, with traffic to known trackers present on 69\% of Roku channels and 89\% of Amazon Fire TV channels. We also discover widespread practice of collecting and transmitting unique identifiers, such as device IDs, serial numbers, WiFi MAC addresses and SSIDs, at times over unencrypted connections. Finally, we show that the countermeasures available on these devices, such as limiting ad tracking options and adblocking, are practically ineffective. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for researchers, regulators, policy makers, and platform/app developers.},

Although a few works have expressed how to make use of Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) leakage of PUF constructions to significantly improve the modeling attacks, little attention has been paid to provide corresponding countermeasures. In this paper, we present a generic technique to operate any PUF primitive in an SCA-secure fashion. We, for the first time, make it possible to apply a provably-secure masking countermeasure - Threshold Implementation (TI) - on a strong PUF design. As a case study, we concentrate on the Interpose PUF and based on practical experiments on an FPGA prototype, we demonstrate the ability of our construction to prevent the recovery of intermediate values through SCA measurements.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sustainability_standards_and_certification&oldid=954938277},
	abstract = {Sustainability standards and certifications are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental such as IFGICT Standard, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are over 400 such standards across the world. The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of Ecolabels and standards for Organic food and other products.  Most standards refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity. A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainably grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as "certification" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.
The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and NGO movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “sweatshop” factories by the likes of Nike, Inc., Levi Strauss \& Co. and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the SA8000 and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the B2B supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the Fairtrade movement, administered by FLO International and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.  An example of a B2B standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the Forest Stewardship Council’s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.
However, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and precompetitive industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient .
With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering real social, environmental and economic results. The ISEAL Alliance has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.
Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI) project, facilitated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI).},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertical_farming&oldid=963161437},
	abstract = {Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops in vertically stacked layers. It often incorporates controlled-environment agriculture, which aims to optimize plant growth, and soilless farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. Some common choices of structures to house vertical farming systems include buildings, shipping containers, tunnels, and abandoned mine shafts.
The modern concept of vertical farming was proposed in 1999 by Dickson Despommier, professor of Public and Environmental Health at Columbia University. Despommier and his students came up with a design of a skyscraper farm that could feed 50,000 people. Although the design has not yet been built, it successfully popularized the idea of vertical farming. Current applications of vertical farmings coupled with other state-of-the-art technologies, such as specialized LED lights, have resulted in over 10 times the crop yield than would receive through traditional farming methods. There have been several different means of implementing vertical farming systems into communities such as: Paignton, Israel, Singapore, Chicago, Munich, London, Japan, and Lincolnshire.The main advantage of utilizing vertical farming technologies is the increased crop yield that comes with a smaller unit area of land requirement. The increased ability to cultivate a larger variety of crops at once because crops do not share the same plots of land while growing is another sought-after advantage. Additionally, crops are resistant to weather disruptions because of their placement indoors, meaning less crops lost to extreme or unexpected weather occurrences. Lastly, because of its limited land usage, vertical farming is less disruptive to the native plants and animals, leading to further conservation of the local flora and fauna.Vertical farming technologies face economic challenges with large start-up costs compared to traditional farms. In Victoria, Australia, a “hypothetical 10 level vertical farm” would cost over 850 times more per cubic meter of arable land than a traditional farm in rural Victoria. Vertical farms also face large energy demands due to the use of supplementary light like LEDs. Moreover, if non-renewable energy is used to meet these energy demands, vertical farms could produce more pollution than traditional farms or greenhouses.},

Suppose also that we have a secret sharing scheme S on n participants. Then under certain assumptions on P and S, we show how to transform P into a witness indistinguishable protocol, in which the prover demonstrates knowledge of the solution to some subset of n problem instances out of a collection of subsets deﬁned by S. For example, using a threshold scheme, the prover can show that he knows at least d out of n solutions without revealing which d instances are involved. If the instances are independently generated, we get a witness hiding protocol, even if P did not have this property. Our results can be used to eﬃciently implement general forms of group oriented identiﬁcation and signatures. Our transformation produces a protocol with the same number of rounds as P and communication complexity n times that of P. Our results use no unproven complexity assumptions.},

In this study, the authors add a self-tallying function to the AV-net, making it a general-purpose voting protocol. The new protocol works in the same setting as the AV-net – it requires no trusted third parties or private channels, and participants execute the protocol by sending two-round public messages. Compared with related voting protocols in past work, this is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient in terms of the number of rounds, computational cost and bandwidth usage.},

However, despite its prevalent use, the security of this feature has received little attention from the research community. In this paper, we present an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of private browsing across four most popular web browsers: IE, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. We report that all browsers under study suffer from a variety of vulnerabilities, many of which have not been reported or known before. Our work highlights the complexity of the subject and calls for more attention from the security community. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Recently, the following Discrimination-Aware Classification Problem was introduced: Suppose we are given training data that exhibit unlawful discrimination; e.g., toward sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. The task is to learn a classifier that optimizes accuracy, but does not have this discrimination in its predictions on test data. This problem is relevant in many settings, such as when the data are generated by a biased decision process or when the sensitive attribute serves as a proxy for unobserved features. In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances. These preprocessing techniques have been implemented in a modified version of Weka and we present the results of experiments on real-life data},

In the context of a simple model of online decision making, we give an algorithm that satisfies this fairness constraint, while still being able to learn at a rate that is comparable to (but necessarily worse than) that of the best algorithms absent a fairness constraint. We prove a regret bound for fair algorithms in the linear contextual bandit framework that is a significant improvement over our technical companion paper [16], which gives black-box reductions in a more general setting. We analyze our algorithms both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we introduce the notion of a "discrimination index", and show that standard algorithms for our problem exhibit structured discriminatory behavior, whereas the "fair" algorithms we develop do not.},

	abstract = {Datasets are an integral part of contemporary object recognition research. They have been the chief reason for the considerable progress in the field, not just as source of large amounts of training data, but also as means of measuring and comparing performance of competing algorithms. At the same time, datasets have often been blamed for narrowing the focus of object recognition research, reducing it to a single benchmark performance number. Indeed, some datasets, that started out as data capture efforts aimed at representing the visual world, have become closed worlds unto themselves (e.g. the Corel world, the Caltech-101 world, the PASCAL VOC world). With the focus on beating the latest benchmark numbers on the latest dataset, have we perhaps lost sight of the original purpose? The goal of this paper is to take stock of the current state of recognition datasets. We present a comparison study using a set of popular datasets, evaluated based on a number of criteria including: relative data bias, cross-dataset generalization, effects of closed-world assumption, and sample value. The experimental results, some rather surprising, suggest directions that can improve dataset collection as well as algorithm evaluation protocols. But more broadly, the hope is to stimulate discussion in the community regarding this very important, but largely neglected issue.},

	doi = {10.1145/2939672.2945386},
	abstract = {Algorithms and decision making based on Big Data have become pervasive in all aspects of our daily lives lives (offline and online), as they have become essential tools in personal finance, health care, hiring, housing, education, and policies. It is therefore of societal and ethical importance to ask whether these algorithms can be discriminative on grounds such as gender, ethnicity, or health status. It turns out that the answer is positive: for instance, recent studies in the context of online advertising show that ads for high-income jobs are presented to men much more often than to women [Datta et al., 2015]; and ads for arrest records are significantly more likely to show up on searches for distinctively black names [Sweeney, 2013]. This algorithmic bias exists even when there is no discrimination intention in the developer of the algorithm. Sometimes it may be inherent to the data sources used (software making decisions based on data can reflect, or even amplify, the results of historical discrimination), but even when the sensitive attributes have been suppressed from the input, a well trained machine learning algorithm may still discriminate on the basis of such sensitive attributes because of correlations existing in the data. These considerations call for the development of data mining systems which are discrimination-conscious by-design. This is a novel and challenging research area for the data mining community. The aim of this tutorial is to survey algorithmic bias, presenting its most common variants, with an emphasis on the algorithmic techniques and key ideas developed to derive efficient solutions. The tutorial covers two main complementary approaches: algorithms for discrimination discovery and discrimination prevention by means of fairness-aware data mining. We conclude by summarizing promising paths for future research.},

	title = {Cryptographic {End}-to-end {Verifiability} for {Real}-world {Elections}},
	abstract = {In this dissertation we study the problem of making electronic voting trustworthy through the use of cryptographic end-to-end (E2E) audits. In particular, we present a series of novel proposals for cryptographic election verification with a focus on real-world practicality. We begin by outlining fundamental requirements of E2E election verification, important properties for a real-world settings, and provide a review of previous and concurrent related work. Our research results are then presented across three parts. {\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater In the first part we examine how E2E election verification can be made more procedurally familiar to real-world voters and election administrators. We propose and implement an E2E add-on for conventional optical-scan based voting systems, and highlight our experiences running an election using this system in a United States municipality. {\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater In the second part we examine how E2E election verification can be made more conceptually and procedurally simple for election verifiers/auditors. We present a non-cryptographic E2E system based on physical document security assumptions as an educational tool. We extend this system to a cryptographic setting to show how the procedures of cryptographic election verification can be completed with relatively tiny software code bases, or by using commonplace programs such as a desktop spreadsheet. We then present an approach that allows verifiers to conduct cryptographic audits without having to plan for it prior to an election. {\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater In the third part we examine how the methods in the first part can be extended to provide a level of privacy/distribution of trust similar to that of classical cryptographic voting protocols, while maintaining the (comparatively) intuitive optical-scan interface. To that end, we propose a novel paradigm for secure distributed document printing that allows optical-scan ballots to be printed in a way that still lets voters check their ballots have been counted, while keeping their voting preferences secret from election officials and everyone else. {\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater Finally we outline how the results obtained in each of the three parts can be combined to create a cryptographically end-to-end verifiable voting system that simultaneously offers a conventional optical-scan ballot, ballot secrecy assured by a distribution of trust, and a simple, cryptographically austere set of audit procedures.},

	abstract = {New applications for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology include embedding transponders in everyday things used by individuals, such as books, payment cards, and personal identification. While RFID technology has existed for decades, these new applications carry with them substantial new privacy and security risks for individuals. These risks arise due to a combination of aspects involved in these applications: (1) The transponders are permanently embedded in objects individuals commonly carry with them (2) Static data linkable to an individual is stored on these transponders (3) The objects these transponders are embedded in are used in public places where individuals have limited control over who can access data on the transponder. In 2002, the U.S. Department of State proposed the adoption of an "electronic passport," which embedded RFID transponders into U.S. passports for identification and document security purposes. In this paper, we use the U.S. Government's adoption process for the electronic passport as a case study for identifying the privacy and security risks that arise by embedding RFID technology in "everyday things." We discuss the reasons why the Department of State did not adequately identify and address these privacy and security risks, even after the government's process mandated a privacy impact assessment. We conclude with recommendations to assist government as well as industry in early identification and resolution of relevant risks posed by RFID technology embedded in everyday things.},

	abstract = {Identification, authentication, and integrity checking are important tasks for ensuring the security and protection of valuable objects, devices, programs, and data. The utilization of the microscopic, random, and unclonable disorder of physical media for such security tasks has recently gained increasing attention. Wherever applicable, the harnessing of disorder can lead to intriguing advantages: First, it can avoid the permanent storage of digital secret keys in vulnerable hardware, promising to make the resulting systems more resilient against invasive and malware attacks. Second, random physical disorder has the natural feature of being very hard to clone and to forge: Fully controlling the micro- and nanoscale fabrication variations in physical media is extremely difficult and, even if possible, prohibitively expensive. Third, utilization of the natural disorder and entropy in physical systems can sometimes enable cryptographic protocols whose security does not rest on the usual unproven number-theoretic assumptions like factoring and discrete log, creating an alternate foundation for cryptography. Physical Unclonable Functions or PUFs are perhaps the best known representative of this new class of “disordered” cryptoprimitives, but there are also others. In this chapter, we provide a classification for past and ongoing work in physical disorder based security alongside with security analyses and implementation examples. We will also outline some open problems and future research opportunities in the area.},

	doi = {10.1145/3092816},
	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. In this article, we propose a novel paper fingerprinting technique based on analyzing the translucent patterns revealed when a light source shines through the paper. These patterns represent the inherent texture of paper, formed by the random interleaving of wooden particles during the manufacturing process. We show that these patterns can be easily captured by a commodity camera and condensed into a compact 2,048-bit fingerprint code. Prominent works in this area (Nature 2005, IEEE S\&P 2009, CCS 2011) have all focused on fingerprinting paper based on the paper "surface." We are motivated by the observation that capturing the surface alone misses important distinctive features such as the noneven thickness, random distribution of impurities, and different materials in the paper with varying opacities. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the embedded paper texture provides a more reliable source for fingerprinting than features on the surface. Based on the collected datasets, we achieve 0\% false rejection and 0\% false acceptance rates. We further report that our extracted fingerprints contain 807 degrees of freedom (DoF), which is much higher than the 249 DoF with iris codes (that have the same size of 2,048 bits). The high amount of DoF for texturebased fingerprints makes our method extremely scalable for recognition among very large databases; it also allows secure usage of the extracted fingerprint in privacy-preserving authentication schemes based on error correction techniques.},

	doi = {10.1145/3092816},
	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. In this article, we propose a novel paper fingerprinting technique based on analyzing the translucent patterns revealed when a light source shines through the paper. These patterns represent the inherent texture of paper, formed by the random interleaving of wooden particles during the manufacturing process. We show that these patterns can be easily captured by a commodity camera and condensed into a compact 2,048-bit fingerprint code. Prominent works in this area (Nature 2005, IEEE S\&P 2009, CCS 2011) have all focused on fingerprinting paper based on the paper "surface." We are motivated by the observation that capturing the surface alone misses important distinctive features such as the noneven thickness, random distribution of impurities, and different materials in the paper with varying opacities. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the embedded paper texture provides a more reliable source for fingerprinting than features on the surface. Based on the collected datasets, we achieve 0\% false rejection and 0\% false acceptance rates. We further report that our extracted fingerprints contain 807 degrees of freedom (DoF), which is much higher than the 249 DoF with iris codes (that have the same size of 2,048 bits). The high amount of DoF for texturebased fingerprints makes our method extremely scalable for recognition among very large databases; it also allows secure usage of the extracted fingerprint in privacy-preserving authentication schemes based on error correction techniques.},

	abstract = {© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Conforming to W3C specifications, mobile web browsers allow JavaScript code in a web page to access motion and orientation sensor data without the user's permission. The associated risks to user security and privacy are however not considered in W3C specifications. In this work, for the first time, we show how user security can be compromised using these sensor data via browser, despite that the data rate is 3-5 times slower than what is available in app. We examine multiple popular browsers on Android and iOS platforms and study their policies in granting permissions to JavaScript code with respect to access to motion and orientation sensor data. Based on our observations, we identify multiple vulnerabilities, and propose TouchSignatures which implements an attack where malicious JavaScript code on an attack tab listens to such sensor data measurements. Based on these streams, TouchSignatures is able to distinguish the user's touch actions (i.e., tap, scroll, hold, and zoom) and her PINs, allowing a remote website to learn the client-side user activities. We demonstrate the practicality of this attack by collecting data from real users and reporting high success rates using our proof-of-concept implementations. We also present a set of potential solutions to address the vulnerabilities. The W3C community and major mobile browser vendors including Mozilla, Google, Apple and Opera have acknowledged our work and are implementing some of our proposed countermeasures.},

	abstract = {Identification, authentication, and integrity checking are important tasks for ensuring the security and protection of valuable objects, devices, programs, and data. The utilization of the microscopic, random, and unclonable disorder of physical media for such security tasks has recently gained increasing attention. Wherever applicable, the harnessing of disorder can lead to intriguing advantages: First, it can avoid the permanent storage of digital secret keys in vulnerable hardware, promising to make the resulting systems more resilient against invasive and malware attacks. Second, random physical disorder has the natural feature of being very hard to clone and to forge: Fully controlling the micro- and nanoscale fabrication variations in physical media is extremely difficult and, even if possible, prohibitively expensive. Third, utilization of the natural disorder and entropy in physical systems can sometimes enable cryptographic protocols whose security does not rest on the usual unproven number-theoretic assumptions like factoring and discrete log, creating an alternate foundation for cryptography. Physical Unclonable Functions or PUFs are perhaps the best known representative of this new class of “disordered” cryptoprimitives, but there are also others. In this chapter, we provide a classification for past and ongoing work in physical disorder based security alongside with security analyses and implementation examples. We will also outline some open problems and future research opportunities in the area.},

	abstract = {Identification, authentication, and integrity checking are important tasks for ensuring the security and protection of valuable objects, devices, programs, and data. The utilization of the microscopic, random, and unclonable disorder of physical media for such security tasks has recently gained increasing attention. Wherever applicable, the harnessing of disorder can lead to intriguing advantages: First, it can avoid the permanent storage of digital secret keys in vulnerable hardware, promising to make the resulting systems more resilient against invasive and malware attacks. Second, random physical disorder has the natural feature of being very hard to clone and to forge: Fully controlling the micro- and nanoscale fabrication variations in physical media is extremely difficult and, even if possible, prohibitively expensive. Third, utilization of the natural disorder and entropy in physical systems can sometimes enable cryptographic protocols whose security does not rest on the usual unproven number-theoretic assumptions like factoring and discrete log, creating an alternate foundation for cryptography. Physical Unclonable Functions or PUFs are perhaps the best known representative of this new class of “disordered” cryptoprimitives, but there are also others. In this chapter, we provide a classification for past and ongoing work in physical disorder based security alongside with security analyses and implementation examples. We will also outline some open problems and future research opportunities in the area.},

	abstract = {Identification, authentication, and integrity checking are important tasks for ensuring the security and protection of valuable objects, devices, programs, and data. The utilization of the microscopic, random, and unclonable disorder of physical media for such security tasks has recently gained increasing attention. Wherever applicable, the harnessing of disorder can lead to intriguing advantages: First, it can avoid the permanent storage of digital secret keys in vulnerable hardware, promising to make the resulting systems more resilient against invasive and malware attacks. Second, random physical disorder has the natural feature of being very hard to clone and to forge: Fully controlling the micro- and nanoscale fabrication variations in physical media is extremely difficult and, even if possible, prohibitively expensive. Third, utilization of the natural disorder and entropy in physical systems can sometimes enable cryptographic protocols whose security does not rest on the usual unproven number-theoretic assumptions like factoring and discrete log, creating an alternate foundation for cryptography. Physical Unclonable Functions or PUFs are perhaps the best known representative of this new class of “disordered” cryptoprimitives, but there are also others. In this chapter, we provide a classification for past and ongoing work in physical disorder based security alongside with security analyses and implementation examples. We will also outline some open problems and future research opportunities in the area.},

	doi = {10.1145/3092816},
	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. In this article, we propose a novel paper fingerprinting technique based on analyzing the translucent patterns revealed when a light source shines through the paper. These patterns represent the inherent texture of paper, formed by the random interleaving of wooden particles during the manufacturing process. We show that these patterns can be easily captured by a commodity camera and condensed into a compact 2,048-bit fingerprint code. Prominent works in this area (Nature 2005, IEEE S\&P 2009, CCS 2011) have all focused on fingerprinting paper based on the paper "surface." We are motivated by the observation that capturing the surface alone misses important distinctive features such as the noneven thickness, random distribution of impurities, and different materials in the paper with varying opacities. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the embedded paper texture provides a more reliable source for fingerprinting than features on the surface. Based on the collected datasets, we achieve 0\% false rejection and 0\% false acceptance rates. We further report that our extracted fingerprints contain 807 degrees of freedom (DoF), which is much higher than the 249 DoF with iris codes (that have the same size of 2,048 bits). The high amount of DoF for texturebased fingerprints makes our method extremely scalable for recognition among very large databases; it also allows secure usage of the extracted fingerprint in privacy-preserving authentication schemes based on error correction techniques.},

	abstract = {© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Conforming to W3C specifications, mobile web browsers allow JavaScript code in a web page to access motion and orientation sensor data without the user's permission. The associated risks to user security and privacy are however not considered in W3C specifications. In this work, for the first time, we show how user security can be compromised using these sensor data via browser, despite that the data rate is 3-5 times slower than what is available in app. We examine multiple popular browsers on Android and iOS platforms and study their policies in granting permissions to JavaScript code with respect to access to motion and orientation sensor data. Based on our observations, we identify multiple vulnerabilities, and propose TouchSignatures which implements an attack where malicious JavaScript code on an attack tab listens to such sensor data measurements. Based on these streams, TouchSignatures is able to distinguish the user's touch actions (i.e., tap, scroll, hold, and zoom) and her PINs, allowing a remote website to learn the client-side user activities. We demonstrate the practicality of this attack by collecting data from real users and reporting high success rates using our proof-of-concept implementations. We also present a set of potential solutions to address the vulnerabilities. The W3C community and major mobile browser vendors including Mozilla, Google, Apple and Opera have acknowledged our work and are implementing some of our proposed countermeasures.},

	abstract = {Many IoT devices, especially those deployed at the network edge have limited power resources. A number of attacks aim to exhaust these resources and drain the batteries of such edge nodes. In this work, we study the effects of a variety of battery draining attacks against edge nodes. Through simulation, we clarify the extent to which such attacks are able to increase the usage and hence waste the power resources of edge nodes. Specifically, we implement hello flooding, packet flooding, selective forwarding, rank attack, and versioning attack in ContikiOS and simulate them in the Cooja simulator, and measure and report a number of time and power resource usage metrics including CPU time, low power mode time, TX/RX time, and battery consumption. Besides, we test the stretch attack with three different batteries as an extreme scenario. Our extensive measurements enable us to compare the effectiveness of these attacks. Our results show that Versioning attack is the most severe attack in terms of draining the power resources of the network, followed by Packet Flooding and Hello Flood attacks. Furthermore, we confirm that Selective Forwarding and Rank attacks are not able to considerably increase the power resource usage in our scenarios. By quantifying the effects of these attacks, we demonstrate that under specific scenarios, Versioning attack can be three to four times as effective as Packet Flooding and Hello Flood attacks in wasting network resources, while Packet Flooding is generally comparable to Hello Flood in CPU and TX time usage increase but twice as powerful in draining device batteries.},

	abstract = {We introduce the area of remote physical device fingerprinting, or fingerprinting a physical device, as opposed to an operating system or class of devices, remotely, and without the fingerprinted device's known cooperation. We accomplish this goal by exploiting small, microscopic deviations in device hardware: clock skews. Our techniques do not require any modification to the fingerprinted devices. Our techniques report consistent measurements when the measurer is thousands of miles, multiple hops, and tens of milliseconds away from the fingerprinted device and when the fingerprinted device is connected to the Internet from different locations and via different access technologies. Further, one can apply our passive and semipassive techniques when the fingerprinted device is behind a NAT or firewall, and. also when the device's system time is maintained via NTP or SNTP. One can use our techniques to obtain information about whether two devices on the Internet, possibly shifted in time or IP addresses, are actually the same physical device. Example applications include: computer forensics; tracking, with some probability, a physical device as it connects to the Internet from different public access points; counting the number of devices behind a NAT even when the devices use constant or random IP IDs; remotely probing a block of addresses to determine if the addresses correspond to virtual hosts, e.g., as part of a virtual honeynet; and unanonymizing anonymized network traces.},

	abstract = {The Web of Things (WoT) standard recently promoted by the W3C constitutes a promising approach to devise interoperable IoT systems able to cope with the heterogeneity of software platforms and devices. The WoT architecture envisages interconnected IoT scenarios characterized by a multitude of Web Things (WTs) that interact according to well-defined software interfaces; at the same time, it assumes static allocations of WTs to hosting devices, and it does not cope with the intrinsic dynamicity of IoT environments in terms of time-varying network and computational loads. In this paper, we extend the WoT paradigm for cloud-edge continuum deployments, hence supporting dynamic orchestration and mobility of WTs among the available computational resources. Differently from state-of-art Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) approaches, we heavily exploit the W3C WoT, and specifically its capability to standardize the software interfaces of the WTs, in order to propose the concept of a Migratable WoT (M-WoT), in which WTs are seamlessly allocated to hosts according to their dynamic interactions. Three main contributions are proposed in this paper. First, we describe the architecture of the M-WoT framework, by focusing on the stateful migration of WTs and on the management of the WT handoff process. Second, we rigorously formulate the WT allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose a graph-based heuristic. Third, we describe a container-based implementation of M-WoT and a twofold evaluation, through which we assess the performance of the proposed migration policy in a distributed edge computing setup and in a real-world IoT monitoring scenario.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach for counterfeit protection against remarked, overproduced, and out-of-spec integrated circuits (ICs). Our approach uses identification sequences that are regularly published by the original chip manufacturer and hidden in the electromagnetic (EM) leakage of authentic chips. A portion of the chip area is dedicated to a crypto engine running in stream cipher mode that is initialized with a unique key and an initialization vector stored in one-time-programmable antifuse memory. IC identification is carried out in the field by obtaining EM measurements of deployed ICs and by proving the presence of the genuine identification sequences in the measurements. We evaluate our approach using a proof-of-concept implementation on three FPGA boards by capturing EM leakage of the FPGAs under test at their decoupling capacitors. The results show that the user can carry out IC identification on-site, using standard lab equipment in short amount of time.},

	url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8439007},
	doi = {8439007},
	abstract = {Conventional password-based authentication is considered inadequate by users as many online services started to affect each other. Online credentials are used to recover other credentials and complex attacks are directed to the weakest one of many of these online credentials. As researchers are looking for new authentication techniques, one time passwords, which is a two-factor authentication scheme, looks like a natural enhancement over conventional username/password schemes. The manuscript places the OTP verifier to the cloud to ease adoption of its usage by cloud service providers. When the OTP verifier is placed on the cloud as a service, other cloud service providers could outsource their OTP deployments as well as cloud users could activate their respective account on the OTP provider on several cloud services. This enables them to use several cloud services without the difficulty of managing several OTP accounts for each cloud service. On the other hand, OTP service provision saves inexperienced small to medium enterprises from spending extra costs for OTP provisioning hardware, software, and employers. The paper outlines architecture to build a secure, privacy-friendly, and sound OTP provider in the cloud to outsource the second factor of authentication. Cloud user registration to OTP provider, service provider activation, and authentication phases are inspected. The security and privacy considerations of the proposed architecture are defined and analyzed. Attacks from outsiders, unlinkability properties of user profiles, attacks from curious service providers or OTP verifiers are mitigated within the given assumptions. The proposed solution, which locates the OTP provider in the cloud, is rendered robust and sound as a result of the analysis.},

                    {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}We are currently experiencing the fourth industrial revolution. This is what the German government initiative, first, has identified with ‘Industry 4.0’. The manufacturing future will be marked and will go through the new automation technologies that are being introduced with Industrial Internet of Things (I2oT). Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are exploiting I2oT for reducing costs and improving efficiency. However, ICSs are already jeopardized by an increasingly large set of threat vectors. Those threats are used by malicious actors to misuse physical Critical Infrastructures that usually are vital services for well-being. I2oT implementation increases the threat surface, generating new possible vulnerabilities. Information Technology (IT) classical approaches to cyber attacks cannot be applied to ICS due to their extreme differences from main priorities to resource constrains. Therefore, innovative approaches and equipment must be developed to suit with ICS world. In this paper, a Smart Behavioural Filter (SBF) for the PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) is proposed aiming to secure the PLC itself against logic attacks, that are stealth for other more classical security approaches. An example of the considered logic attacks is many open and close commands towards a valve in a short time. Those logic attacks are usually a sequence of well-formed packets in which the content represents an anomalous and unpredicted behaviour. This smart field equipment can react in short time to cyber attacks isolating the PLC, communicate with other equipment like itself and increasing in general the resilience of the physical system. It can also generate alarms for the local Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The proposed equipment has been developed and validated in a real test-bed within the FP7 CockpitCI project and H2020 ATENA project.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As a result, a new paradigm called multi-access edge computing has emerged in recent years. It complements the centralized cloud platform by providing additional resources at the edge of radio access networks, and provides better support of IoT applications. One of the challenges of supporting IoT applications in mobile edge computing (MEC) is security. In this article, we will scrutinize the security issues of two IoT applications that can exploit the benefits of MEC.

	abstract = {Blockchain, as the backbone technology of the current popular Bitcoin digital currency, has become a promising decentralized data management framework. Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics), its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data (i.e., a block) to the blockchain. Solving the proof of work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. We first introduce a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then we introduce an economic approach for edge computing resource management. Moreover, a prototype of mobile edge computing enabled blockchain systems is presented with experimental results to justify the proposed concept.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the Space Information Network (SIN) has been widely used in real life because of its advantages of communicating anywhere at any time. This feature is leading to a new trend that traditional wireless users are willing to roam to SIN to obtain a better service. However, the features of exposed links and higher signal latency in SIN make it difficult to design a secure and fast roaming authentication scheme for this new trend. Although some existing researches have been focused on designing secure authentication protocols for SIN or providing roaming authentication protocols for traditional wireless networks, these schemes cannot provide adequate requirements for the roaming communication in SIN and bring in critical issues, such as the privacy leakage or intolerable authentication delay. Observing these problems have not been well addressed, we design an anonymous and fast roaming authentication scheme for SIN. In our scheme, we utilize the group signature to provide the anonymity for roaming users, and assume that the satellites have limited computing capacity and make them have the defined authentication function to avoid the real-time involvement of the home network control center when authenticating the roaming users. The results of security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme can provide the required security features, while providing a small authentication delay.},

We consider different typing scenarios, and propose multiple attack approaches to exploit the characteristics of the observed wrist movements for inferring individual key presses. Experimental evaluation using commercial off-the-shelf smartwatches and smartphones show that key press inference using smartwatch motion sensors is not only fairly accurate, but also comparable with similar attacks using smartphone motion sensors. Additionally, hand movements captured by a combination of both smartwatch and smartphone motion sensors yields better inference accuracy than either device considered individually.},

	doi = {8258935},
	abstract = {The widely used RFID systems are vulnerable to the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks launched by malicious blocker tags. This paper studies how to quickly and completely identify the valid RFID tags that are blocked. The existing work that can seemingly address this problem suffers from either low time-efficiency or serious false positives. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that consists of two complementary component protocols, namely {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Aloha Filtering (AF){\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Poll\&Listen (PL){\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}AF{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} is fast but inaccurate, while {\textless}italic{\textgreater}PL{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} is accurate but slow. Taking the merit of each protocol, our hybrid approach is to first\&\#x00A0;repeat the fast {\textless}italic{\textgreater}AF{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} for multiple rounds to quickly filter out the target tags that are definitely not blocked. Then, on the size-reduced remaining set that just contains a small number of suspicious tags, we invoke the accurate {\textless}italic{\textgreater}PL{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} to verify the intactness of each suspicious tag with 100 percent confidence. We optimize the round count of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}AF{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} that trades off between the time costs of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}AF {\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}PL{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} to minimize the total time of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}AF+PL{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. As required in the optimization process, we need to know the size of the blocked tag set and that of the unknown tag set, which, however, are not known in advance. To estimate these two set sizes, we propose a supplementary protocol called {\textless}italic{\textgreater} Simultaneous Estimation of the Blocked tag size and the Unknown tag size (SEBU){\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. The key advantages of our approach over the prior art are four-fold. First, unlike the detection protocol that just discovers the existence of blocking attacks, our approach exactly identifies all the blocked target tags. Second, our approach is compliant with the C1G2 standard, and does not require any modifications to be made to the commercial RFID tags. It only needs to be installed on -
eaders as a software module. Third, our approach does not involve any false positives. Finally, our approach significantly reduces the execution time when compared with the state-of-the-art schemes that can completely identify the blocked tags.},

	abstract = {In the area of espionage between countries, an infiltration covert channel used to trigger a silent malware installed on a network of a critical organization (such as 911 services and missile launching facility) from the outside world is extremely dangerous to the target country’s security. In order to prevent attackers from establishing such a channel, these organizations take various steps to secure their networks, to make the establishment of this type of covert channel very challenging and almost impractical to achieve; the current state of the art methods are very limited and ineffective. In this paper, we show that even a strong isolation technique, such as air-gapping the network, can be circumvented by using an organizational multifunction printer (MFP) to establish an infiltration covert channel in order to communicate with a malware installed on an isolated organization from the outside. We show how an attacker can leverage the light sensitivity of an MFP and use different light sources to infiltrate commands to the malware in the organization. We analyze the influence of light intensity, distance, transmission rate, ambient light, and wavelength on the covert channel. In addition we demonstrate the attack on a real organization using: 1) a laser attached to a tripod stand; 2) a laser carried by a drone; and 3) a hijacked smart bulb that is not even connected to the organization’s network and is accessed and controlled by an attacker in a passing car. We prove that locating the scanner in an inner room inside an organization does not prevent an attacker from establishing the covert channel. We show how our covert channel can be established from a greater distance (900 m) and at a higher transmission rate of 200 bits/s than other methods used to infiltrate data to an organization, even using invisible light (covertly).},

	abstract = {As mobile devices ownership becomes more prevalent (e.g., a user owns multiple mobile devices), the capability to offer secure and user friendly authentication becomes increasingly important. A large number of identity-based user authentication mechanisms for the wireless mobile environment have been proposed. However, they are not generally designed for situations where a user’s private key and some other sensitive data can be exposed if his/her mobile device is remotely or physically controlled by an attacker. Threshold secret sharing is one of the solutions to this problem, but it is limited in the requirement that there should exist an honest third-party to hold the complete key after the secret reconstruction process. Therefore, in this paper, we consider the special case that only two devices (i.e., no honest party) at the user’s side jointly perform user authentication with a server, and neither device can successfully complete the authentication process alone. Moreover, the key reconstruction is not needed during authentication so that neither device can hold a complete key. We then analyze the security of the proposed protocol and show that it satisfies all known security requirements in practical applications, particularly the key exposure attack resistance. The performance analysis of the proposed protocol is also presented to demonstrate its practicality.},

Efficient resource provisioning functionalities are needed to address these demanding constraints introduced by smart city applications while minimizing resource costs and maximizing QoS. In this article, the CoT framework is presented, which provides not only data collection and analysis functionalities but also automated resource provisioning mechanisms for future smart city applications. CoT is deployed as a smart city testbed in Antwerp, Belgium, which allows researchers and developers to easily set up and validate IoT experiments.

Therefore, users need to make sure that the servers correctly store the outsourced big data prior to deploying the cloud computing applications in practice. To resolve the issue, many researchers have concentrated on enabling users to check the completeness of data with data integrity verification (DIV) technique. We have therefore collated a summary of the existing literature, aiming to present a solid and stimulating review of current academic achievements for interested readers. Firstly, we present a fundamental introduction by defining seven major topics in order to offer a summary of the existing research domain for DIV study. Secondly, we classify the state-of-the-art DIV solutions into four categories, and then we parse each category based on dynamics, providing a clear and hierarchical classification of forthcoming DIV efforts.

The focus and novelty of this paper is the development of efficient impersonation attacks on the following five Arbiter PUF–based authentication protocols: 1) the so-called Poly PUF protocol of Konigsmark et al. as published in the IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems in 2016; 2) the so-called OB-PUF protocol of Gao et al. as presented at the IEEE Conference PerCom 2016; 3) the so-called RPUF protocol of Ye et al. as presented at the IEEE Conference AsianHOST 2016; 4) the so-called LHS-PUF protocol of Idriss and Bayoumi as presented at the IEEE Conference RFID-TA 2017; and 5) the so-called PUF–FSM protocol of Gao et al. as published in the IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems in 2018. The common flaw of all five designs is that the use of lightweight obfuscation logic provides insufficient protection against machine-learning attacks.},

It is noteworthy that a card-based protocol can be easily executed by non-experts such as high school students without the use of any electric device. One of the main goals in this discipline is to develop efficient protocols. The efficiency has been evaluated by the number of required cards, the number of colors, and the average number of protocol trials. Although these evaluation metrics are simple and reasonable, it is difficult to estimate the total number of operations or execution time of protocols based only on these three metrics. Therefore, in this paper, we consider adding other metrics to estimate the execution time of protocols more precisely. Furthermore, we actually evaluate some of the important existing protocols using our new criteria.},

Building on the invisible-to-visible technology concept, this article explores how the full potential of multisensory extended reality (XR) experiences may be unleashed in Multiverse cross-reality environments. We exploit the convergence of artificial-intelligence-enhanced multi-access edge computing, intelligent mobile robots, and blockchain technologies to help realize the Internet of No Things as an important stepping stone toward ushering in the 6G post-smartphone era. In our experiments, we consider locally connected human-avatar/robot collectives and investigate our proposed extrasensory perception network, which integrates the three evolutionary mobile computing stages of ubiquitous, pervasive, and persuasive computing.

The present paper considers the specific context of a smart home, which represents one of the main IoT application domains, and it focuses on two solutions proposed in the literature to cope with the aforementioned issues. On the one side, approaches based on attribute-based encryption (ABE) allow one to encrypt data for multiple recipients, in such a way that only those recipients whose attributes satisfy a given access policy can decrypt afterward. ABE guarantees a high level of customization due to the variety of attributes which can be defined, and it is also flexible enough to be adapted to different kinds of scenarios. On the other side, approaches based on sticky policies allow to attach an access policy directly to the data itself, and to employ a trusted authority to evaluate and enforce the policy itself. Sticky policies also guarantee a highly distributed and customizable enforcement of access control rules. In this paper, we compare the advantages and the drawbacks in terms of performance and robustness of such two techniques by means of their integration within the prototype of an IoT middleware, named networked smart object. Hence, the effectiveness of the presented solutions is validated by means of a real test-bed in the smart home scenario, in terms of storage occupancy, CPU load, and data retrieval delay. The final goal is to reveal the best approach to be used depending on the application's requirements.},

That information is very sensitive and can be used to generate reports on the parking history of drivers, posing a threat on their privacy. This paper proposes a pay-by-phone parking system in which the service provider is prevented from being able to track the parking transactions of drivers. The new proposal requires drivers to be connected only at the beginning of a parking transaction, or at the moment of indicating that a parking transaction took less time than expected. Prototype experiments have shown that the new proposal is much more efficient, in terms of computational cost, than the most complete previous existing system, while providing the same functionalities and higher security.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Given the significant privacy and security risks of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, it seems desirable to nudge consumers towards buying more secure devices and taking privacy into account in the purchase decision. In order to support this goal, this study examines the effect of security and privacy on IoT device purchase behaviour and assesses whether these effects are sensitive to framing, using a mixed methods approach. The first part of the study focuses on quantifying the effect of security and privacy compared to the effect of other device attributes such as price or functionality, by testing a causal model with choice models that have been developed from stated choice data. The second part aims to reveal the underlying mechanisms that determine the effect of privacy and security on purchase behaviour by means of a qualitative survey. The results suggest that security and privacy can strongly affect purchase behaviour, under the circumstances that privacy- and security-related information is available and communicated in an understandable manner, allowing consumers to compare devices. Moreover, the results show that a description of security that focuses on gains is more effective in nudging consumers towards buying secure devices. Future efforts could build upon this study by comparing the effect of security and privacy to more device attributes, such as ease of use or cost reduction. The results can serve as a basis for interventions that nudge consumers towards buying more secure and privacy-friendly devices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The interoperability problems that originate from the heterogeneity in protocols and platforms is one of the main challenges currently faced by the Internet of Things (IoT). The Web of Things (WoT) is an architectural solution to this issue based on leveraging the Web as a means to ensure interoperability. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is currently behind one of the most relevant WoT initiatives—a group of building blocks to serve as a possible foundation for the WoT. This work describes an experimental framework based on the W3C WoT, including a set of concrete and original protocol binding implementations (HTTP, Websockets, MQTT and CoAP). One of the main novelties is that all protocol binding implementations have support for all interaction verbs from the WoT interaction model. The framework is especially adequate to build WoT applications for devices on all layers of the fog computing model; this multi-layer integration is achieved by leveraging the W3C WoT architecture and interaction model. A functional implementation in Python is also described, including low-level designs and implementation details for the binding templates. The behavior of the framework and the protocol bindings is studied by implementing a benchmark application under multiple conditions and hardware platforms. Finally, recommendations are extracted from the obtained results for the most adequate protocols for each scenario and interaction verb.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

applications interfaced via a web API that conforms to the W3C Web of Things

languages, provides a modern graphical control interface, and minimises
duplicated code. Network control also makes the software stack more robust,
allows multiple microscopes to be controlled by one computer, and facilitates

Generally, an app developer can manually discover, select, and compose a set of appropriate web APIs to build a new app satisfying the developer's functional and nonfunctional business requirements, economically and conveniently. However, the above manual web APIs selection process is usually time-consuming and cumbersome as most app developers often do not have much background knowledge of candidate web APIs. Moreover, the manually selected web APIs cannot always guarantee to be integrated successfully as the compatibilities between different web APIs are often varied and not validated. In view of these challenges, we define a weighted APIs correlation graph (W-ACG) in this paper to model the APIs functions and compatibilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel web APIs recommendation approach named Keywords-based and Compatibility-aware APIs Recommendation (K-CAR) based on the defined W-ACG. Through analyzing the input keywords describing the functions expected by an app developer, K-CAR can return the app developer a set of optimal APIs that are not only functional-qualified but also compatibility-guaranteed. Extensive experiments are deployed on 18 478 real-world web APIs and 6146 real-world apps to evaluate the usefulness and efficiency of K-CAR.},

The numerous solutions and technologies reflect a fragmented landscape, in which the interoperability among heterogeneous and geographically distributed computer systems,́thingś and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platforms remains unachieved. The Web of Things (WoT) initiative of the Web of Things Working Group aims at developing standards for the WoT to expose the potential of the IoT while addressing its current fragmentation, and encourage the growth of the market for the IoT devices and services. However, towards attaining seamless interoperability in the WoT, a challenging question is: Are standards sufficient to ensure interoperability in the WoT? Towards answering this research question, this article aims to identify existing WoT interoperability standardization initiatives and discuss the role and ability of standards to ensure interoperability in the WoT. Recommendations for moving forward towards attaining seamless interoperability in the WoT are advanced.},

	abstract = {The Web of Things (WoT) standard recently promoted by the W3C constitutes a promising approach to devise interoperable IoT systems able to cope with the heterogeneity of software platforms and devices. The WoT architecture envisages interconnected IoT scenarios characterized by a multitude of Web Things (WTs) that interact according to well-defined software interfaces; at the same time, it assumes static allocations of WTs to hosting devices, and it does not cope with the intrinsic dynamicity of IoT environments in terms of time-varying network and computational loads. In this paper, we extend the WoT paradigm for cloud-edge continuum deployments, hence supporting dynamic orchestration and mobility of WTs among the available computational resources. Differently from state-of-art Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) approaches, we heavily exploit the W3C WoT, and specifically its capability to standardize the software interfaces of the WTs, in order to propose the concept of a Migratable WoT (M-WoT), in which WTs are seamlessly allocated to hosts according to their dynamic interactions. Three main contributions are proposed in this paper. First, we describe the architecture of the M-WoT framework, by focusing on the stateful migration of WTs and on the management of the WT handoff process. Second, we rigorously formulate the WT allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose a graph-based heuristic. Third, we describe a container-based implementation of M-WoT and a twofold evaluation, through which we assess the performance of the proposed migration policy in a distributed edge computing setup and in a real-world IoT monitoring scenario.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) enables connectivity between devices, thereby allowing them to interact with each other. A recurring problem is the emergence of siloed IoT platforms due to proprietary standards. Recently, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) proposed a human-readable and machine-understandable format called Thing Description (TD). It allows to uniformly describe device and service interfaces of different IoT standards with syntactic and semantic information, and hence enables semantic interoperability. However, describing the sequential behavior of devices, which is essential for many cyber-physical systems, is not covered. In this paper, we extend our initial contribution of describing such sequential behavior as an extension within TDs, thereby increasing their semantic expressiveness through possible, valid state transitions. This enables safe and desired operation of devices as well as scalability by modeling systems as sequential compositions of Things. We show in a case study that previously unmodelable behavior can now be expressed and the overall manual intervention requirements of the state-of-the-art implementations can be significantly reduced.},

	abstract = {The chaotic growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) determined a fragmented landscape with a huge number of devices, technologies and platforms available on the market, and the consequential issues of interoperability on many system deployments. The Web of Things (WoT) architecture recently proposed by the W3C consortium constitutes a novel solution to enable interoperability across IoT platforms and application domains. At the same time, in order to see an effective improvement, a wide adoption of the W3C WoT solutions from the academic and industrial communities is required; this translates into the need of well-defined and complete support tools easing the deployment of W3C WoT applications. In this paper, we meet such requirement by proposing the WoT Store, a novel platform for managing and easing the deployment of Things and applications on the W3C WoT. The WoT Store allows the dynamic discovery of the resources available in the environment, i.e. the Things, and to interact with each of them through a dashboard, by visualizing their properties, executing commands or observing the notifications produced. In addition, similar to popular app stores, the WoT Store allows the search and execution of third-party WoT applications that interact with the available Things again in a seamless way. We validate the operations of our framework with two evaluation studies. First, through a small-case testbed, we demonstrate the Thing discovery and the possibility to run WoT applications that orchestrate the operations of multiple, heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Second, through a mixed real/simulated large-scale crowdsensing scenario, we demonstrate the scalability of the platform, and the possibility to aggregate and visualize the data-streams produced by the WoT applications with minimal efforts for the users.},

The WoT Thing Description supports a descriptive (as opposed to prescriptive) approach to interoperability. The provision of rich descriptive metadata has at least ﬁve major implications for security. First, the need for local links and, more generally, the intermittently connected and segmented networks often used in IoT raises several practical considerations regarding what metadata should be provided. Second, metadata allows for system-wide vulnerability analysis, which can be both a risk and an opportunity. Third, metadata can enable end-to-end security in multistandards networks, avoiding exposing unencrypted data within bridges otherwise needed for adapting standards pairwise. Fourth, metadata supports service and device discovery, which raises the question of how to limit discovery to authorized agents. Fifth, metadata can enable distributed security mechanisms for access control and micropayments. To the extent that metadata access can be decentralized, decentralized mechanisms for security can be supported.},

For the ease of life, the usage of IoT devices, sensors, and Radio-Frequency Identifications (RFIDs) increased rapidly. Such as in transport for monitoring vehicles, taxi services, healthcare for patient’s health condition monitoring, smart cars, smart grids, and smart homes, etc. Due to this for financial gain attackers are targeting these networks or protocol and adversaries are trying to damage the reputation of the organization or to steal intellectual property. From the last two decades or more, the injection vulnerabilities are more threatening security risks for the web application still exists. The new security challenges occur for the security professional or security researchers in the form of IoT or WoT (Web of Things) communication protocols implementation. These protocol Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), WebSockets, and RestAPI have a different type of security issues. Respectively insertion of fake devices, authentication is not implemented in WebSocket connections, and user’s privacy can be leaked with the use of RestAPI without its validation. We have developed a program in Personal Home Pages (PHP) for the detection of new devices in the IoT network. With this, the user’s privacy and data will be protected along with some critical security issues of WoT underlying protocols.},

The heterogeneity of hardware sensors, communication protocols and data formats constitutes one of the main challenge toward the large-scale adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm on industrial environments. To this purpose, the W3C Web of Things (WoT) group is working on the definition of some reference standards intended to describe in a uniform way the software interfaces of IoT devices and services, and hence to achieve the full interoperability among different IoT components regardless of their implementation. At the same time, due also to the recent appearance of the WoT W3C draft, few testbed and real-world deployments of the W3C WoT architecture has been proposed so far in the literature. In this paper, we attempt to fill such gap by describing the realization of a WoT monitoring application of a generic indoor production site: the system is able to orchestrate the sensing operations from three heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We describe how the components of the W3C WoT architecture have been instantiated in our scenario. Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility to decouple the mash-up policies from the network functionalities, and we evaluate the overhead introduced by the WoT approach.},

Further, research challenges have been investigated to incorporate the lacuna inside the current trends of architectures to motivate the academics and industries get involved into seeking the possible way outs to apt the exact power of Internet of Things.

In this paper, we propose using a brain-inspired architecture called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) for HT detection. Similar to the human brain, our proposed solution is resilient against natural changes that might happen in the side-channel measurements while being able to accurately detect abnormal behavior of the chip when the HT gets triggered. We use a self-referencing method for HT detection, which eliminates the need for the golden chip. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated using TrustHub benchmarks, which shows 92.20\% detection accuracy on average.},

The prior channel-based PLA schemes use a quantization algorithm to deal with multiple channel-based features for simplicity.

	abstract = {Polymer banknotes are the trend for printed currency and have been adopted by more than fifty countries worldwide. However, over the past years, the quantity of polymer counterfeits has been increasing, so has the quality of counterfeits. This shows that the initial advantage of bringing a new polymer technology to fight against counterfeiting is reducing. To maintain one step ahead of counterfeiters, we propose a novel anti-counterfeiting technique called Polymer Substrate Fingerprinting (PSF). Our technique is built based on the observation that the opacity coating, a critical step during the production of polymer notes, is a stochastic manufacturing process, leaving uneven thickness in the coating layer and the random dispersion of impurities from the ink. The imperfections in the coating layer result in random translucent patterns when a polymer banknote is back-lit by a light source. We show these patterns can be reliably captured by a commodity negative-film scanner and processed into a compact fingerprint to uniquely identify each banknote. Using an extensive dataset of 6,200 sample images collected from 340 UK banknotes, we show that our method can reliably authenticate banknotes, and is robust against rough daily handling of banknotes. Furthermore, we show the extracted fingerprints contain around 900 bits of entropy, which makes it extremely scalable to identify every polymer note circulated globally. As compared with previous or existing anti-counterfeiting mechanisms for banknotes, our method has a distinctive advantage: it ensures that even in the extreme case when counterfeiters have procured the same printing equipment and ink as used by a legitimate government, counterfeiting banknotes remains infeasible because of the difficulty to replicate a stochastic manufacturing process.},

It mainly consists of sensors that acquire information for the system and actuators that do actions in response to instructions from the system.

The actuators here are used to lock and unlock doors, switch on/off the lights and alert users of any warnings or control the temperature of a room or the whole house. The sensors are used to send feedback to the controller of each small system of those systems mentioned above. For example, they send feedback about the condition of the rooms and whether there are any people in the rooms or not, and accordingly, the controller sends its signals to the actuators to turn off unnecessary working devices such as the lights and the air conditioner. Transducer terminology is used for both sensors and actuators. It means a device that converts energy form to another. In this chapter, different types of sensors and actuators are thoughtfully presented and discussed. Actuators may be written, sensors may be read. Moreover, different controllers used in IoT are discussed with its programming methods.},

However, there are still technical challenges in the coding efficiency and heterogeneous platform supports. In this paper, we propose a lightweight distributed JavaScript engine, WebletScript, to help IoT developers to build applications for a group of heterogeneous IoT devices. WebletScript can run on any device that supports normal C libraries. It enables automatic code slicing and distribution for an IoT application. Therefore, with one-time platform-independent code development, the application can be executed on multiple devices, such as a group of end devices, a smart gateway and the cloud system. Compared to the traditional solution, in which embedded application and cloud application are developed separately, our approach can reduce the lines of code effectively by 50\% and reduce the cost of application update cost by 65\%.},

					Currently, two technologies stand out in the field of research, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Javascript (JS). On one hand, IoT enables everyday objects to connect to the network, analyze, capture, and interact with the environment. On the other hand, we have JS, a programming language that was initially inside browsers but now it is being used in several backgrounds. This paper correlates IoT and JS technologies, showing how Javascript can be applied in the context of the Internet of Things. The survey has considered the work of the last ten years and presents state of the art from Javascript applied to the IoT-side.},

	abstract = {Emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency-based technologies are redefining the way we conduct business in cyberspace. Today, a myriad of blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, applications, and technologies are widely available to companies, end-users, and even malicious actors who want to exploit the computational resources of regular users through {\textbackslash}textit\{cryptojacking\} malware. Especially with ready-to-use mining scripts easily provided by service providers (e.g., Coinhive) and untraceable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Monero), cryptojacking malware has become an indispensable tool for attackers. Indeed, the banking industry, major commercial websites, government and military servers (e.g., US Dept. of Defense), online video sharing platforms (e.g., Youtube), gaming platforms (e.g., Nintendo), critical infrastructure resources (e.g., routers), and even recently widely popular remote video conferencing/meeting programs (e.g., Zoom during the Covid-19 pandemic) have all been the victims of powerful cryptojacking malware campaigns. Nonetheless, existing detection methods such as browser extensions that protect users with blacklist methods or antivirus programs with different analysis methods can only provide a partial panacea to this emerging cryptojacking issue as the attackers can easily bypass them by using obfuscation techniques or changing their domains or scripts frequently. Therefore, many studies in the literature proposed cryptojacking malware detection methods using various dynamic/behavioral features.},

	abstract = {Various communication protocols are currently used in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the protocols that are already standardized by ISO is MQTT protocol (ISO / IEC 20922: 2016). Many IoT developers use this protocol because of its minimal bandwidth requirement and low memory consumption. Sometimes, IoT device sends confidential data that should only be accessed by authorized people or devices. Unfortunately, the MQTT protocol only provides authentication for the security mechanism which, by default, does not encrypt the data in transit thus data privacy, authentication, and data integrity become problems in MQTT implementation. This paper discusses several reasons on why there are many IoT system that does not implement adequate security mechanism. Next, it also demonstrates and analyzes how we can attack this protocol easily using several attack scenarios. Finally, after the vulnerabilities of this protocol have been examined, we can improve our security awareness especially in MQTT protocol and then implement security mechanism in our MQTT system to prevent such attack.},

This paper will review some existing solutions used to secure a communication channel, such as Transport Layer Security or symmetric encryption, as well as provide a novel approach to achieving confidentiality and integrity of messages. The method, called Value-to-Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (Value-to-HMAC) mapping, uses signatures to send messages, instead of encryption, by implementing a Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code generation algorithm. Although robust solutions exist that can be used to secure the communication between devices, this paper considers that not every Internet of Things (IoT) device or network design is able to afford the overhead and drop in performance, or even support such protocols. Therefore, the Value-to-HMAC method was designed to maximize performance while ensuring the messages are only readable by the intended node. The experimental procedure demonstrates how the method will achieve better performance than a symmetric-key encryption algorithm, while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of information through the use of one mechanism.},

This paper focuses on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, widely adopted in the Internet of Things. This protocol does not implement natively secure authentication mechanisms, which are demanded to developers. Hence, this paper proposes a novel OTP (one-time password)-authentication schema for MQTT, which uses the Ethereum blockchain to implement a second-factor out-of-band channel. The proposal enables the authentication of both local and remote devices preserving user privacy and guaranteeing trust and accountability via Ethereum smart contracts.},

The Internet of Things protocol and its system node authentication mechanism have great research value. This paper analyzes the MQTT protocol and its security authentication mechanism, and designs and implements an identity authentication mechanism based on historical information nodes. The proposed authentication mechanism can effectively prevent forgery attacks, counterfeit attacks, replay attacks, and Sybil attacks.},

	abstract = {Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a de facto standard for various Internet of Things (IoT) and industrial IoT applications. The data produced by a publisher are delivered to several subscribers via an MQTT broker. However, the MQTT standard lacks security-related functionalities, such as mutual authentication, access control, control message security, and end-to-end security. According to a recent report, many security threats and flaws associated with MQTT have been identified worldwide. This paper proposes security architecture and protocols to bootstrap MQTT security in the wireless sensor network. Security bootstrapping for MQTT includes security credential generation and distribution; registration protocol for joining MQTT entities such as publishers, subscribers, and brokers to the security controller; and rekeying protocol for group membership management. Special attention is given to the end-to-end security between the publishers and subscribers because the data from the publishers should not be corrupted by, and exposed to, the compromised broker. Both security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed security architecture and protocols for secure MQTT can be a viable solution to enhance MQTT security.},

In today's modern era, air monitoring can utilize applications on our technology and internet devices, it can be an interesting and efficient thing to monitor. In this Internet of things project the monitoring system built by integrating software and hardware with device microcontroller and low-cost sensor MQ 135 and DHT 11. Node sensor produces data and processed with a microcontroller. The resulting data then immediately transmitted to the cloud by internet network using MQTT and combine with Node.js MQTT open source clients used to publish messages and subscribe to topics on brokers. Wireless Sensor Network also applied so sensor nodes can be placed anywhere and data can be acquired into one dashboard display. A web-based dashboard was built to facilitate access of information from existing air quality in different room.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system or framework of things or objects that have internet connectivity as well as that are interrelated and are capable to collect and exchange information without human intervention over a wireless network. Most of the IoT applications such as medical applications require real time and secure exchange of information among connected devices. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a communication protocol used for real time communication between networks with limited bandwidth as it is significantly lightweight. Even though security of using MQTT is still a matter of concern for using it in IoT network, MQTT is still prime choice for IoT communication protocol as there is no alternative has yet been developed. Authors of this article have reviewed numerous published researches on secure MQTT protocol for IoT network and discover some alarming security loop holes of MQTT communication protocol on IoT application network that need to be addressed. The prime aim of this work is to propose a secure and real time MQTT protocol for IoT application without compromising any loss of data. The research has been implemented in Raspberry Pi 3B system using Python 3.4.10 development platform along with Numpy 1.11.1 and scipy 0.18.0 (for mathematical analysis), paho-mqtt 1.5.0 (for MQTT publication/subscription), and Chromium (for displaying research result). The output of this research shows that the proposed MQTT protocol has tighten security during exchanging information over IoT network without any loss of data.},

Using this protocol limitations resulting from constrained networks in rural areas are avoided. Collected data from sensors is shown and stored in web part of the information system. An architecture of the web application is described as a client-server three-tier architecture in which the graphical user interface (presentation layer), application functions and logic (application layer) and computer data storage (database layer) are developed and maintained as independent modules, on separate platforms. This type of implementation is developed by the manufacturers need for monitoring and tracking data. This architecture is based on future concrete implementation, at least in segments, in several agricultural facilities in Virovitica-Podravina County.},

Experimental tests were performed to measure latency by calculating the time difference of packets exchanged between a server and an ESP8266 using both protocols. It has been found that the use of WebSocket is more appropriate than MQTT in applications with RTT of at least 1 millisecond according to the data and contexts presented in that article.},

But a precision agriculture system needs continuous monitoring of all the climatic conditions. We propose a MQTT protocol based smart farming solution to collect knowledge from the field ambience for continuous analysis and also to develop and deploy a smart technology for agriculture sector for improving environmental and agricultural sustainability to improve crop traceability and to increase overall yield. The focus area of the proposed system is environmental parameters such as crops temperature, ambient humidity, soil moisture level and light intensity.

The analysis shows a negligible effect of printing direction, yet, using the shape descriptor indexes, the printing materials and technologies are distinguishable under a microscopic scale. As a result, the algorithms based on Support Vectors Machine and Random Forest are developed, with shape descriptor indexes as features, for printing source identification. Both proposed algorithms, equally, achieve a high classification accuracy rate, over 92\% accuracy with complex geometric-shape patterns.

In this thesis, we consider a method to test if a PCB is genuine. One high-level solution is to use a secret identifier of the board, together with a cryptographic authentication protocol. We describe a mechanism that authenticates all major components of PCB as part of attesting the PCB. Our authentication protocol constructs the fingerprint of PCB by extracting hardware fingerprint from the components on PCB and cryptographically combining the fingerprints. Fingerprints from each component on PCB are developed using Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF). 
 
In this thesis, we present a PUF based authentication protocol for remote integrity checking using multiple PUF component level identifiers. We address the design on 3 different abstraction levels. 1)Hardware Level, 2)Hardware Integration level, 3)Protocol level. On the hardware level, we propose an approach to develop PUF from flash memory component on the device. At the hardware Integration level, we discuss a hardware solution for implementing a trustworthy PUF based authentication. We present a prototype of the PUF based authentication protocol on an FPGA board via network sockets.},

This paper brings together key scientific uncertainties regarding the use of serological tests to assure immune status and a public health ethics perspective to inform key considerations in the ethical implementation of immunity passport policies. Ill-conceived policies have the potential to cause severe unintended harms that could result in greater inequity, the stigmatization of certain sectors of society, and heightened risks and unequal treatment of individuals due to erroneous test results. Immunity passports could, however, be used to achieve collective benefits and benefits for specific populations besides facilitating economic recovery. We conclude that sector-based policies that prioritize access to testing based on societal need are likely to be fairer and logistically more feasible, while minimizing stigma and reducing incentives for fraud. Clear guidelines need to be set out for which sectors of society should be prioritized for testing, and rigorous mechanisms should be in place to validate test results and identify cases of reinfection.},

	abstract = {There is much debate about the use of immunity passports in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some have argued that immunity passports are unethical and impractical, pointing to uncertainties relating to COVID-19 immunity, issues with testing, perverse incentives, doubtful economic benefits, privacy concerns, and the risk of discriminatory effects. We first review the scientific feasibility of immunity passports. Considerable hurdles remain, but increasing understanding of the neutralising antibody response to COVID-19 might make identifying members of the community at low risk of contracting and transmitting COVID-19 possible. We respond to the ethical arguments against immunity passports and give the positive ethical arguments. First, a strong presumption should be in favour of preserving people's free movement if at all feasible. Second, failing to recognise the reduced infection threat immune individuals pose risks punishing people for low-risk behaviour. Finally, further individual and social benefits are likely to accrue from allowing people to engage in free movement. Challenges relating to the implementation of immunity passports ought to be met with targeted solutions so as to maximise their benefit.},

	abstract = {Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 `Immunity Passport' has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back to work. While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving certification for test results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with no other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for scalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called `Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data platform `Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our mobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly in the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is `just another app' which takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically, and in effect `waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.},

	abstract = {Due to the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a push for `immunity passports' and even technical proposals. Although the debate about the medical and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes. These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of `cryptography theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization. Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity totalitarianism.},

This survey investigates how blockchain technology can be useful in the scope of supporting health actions that can reduce the spread of COVID-19 infections and allow a return to normality. Since the prominent use of blockchains to mitigate COVID-19 consequences are in the area of contact tracing and vaccine/immunity passport support, the survey mainly focuses on these two classes of applications. The aim of the survey is to show that only a proper combination of blockchain technology with advanced cryptographic techniques can guarantee a secure and privacy preserving support to fight COVID-19. In particular, this article first presents these techniques, i.e. zero-knowledge, Diffie Hellman, blind signatures, and proxy re-encryption, then describes how they are used in combination with blockchains to define robust and privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, a brief description of blockchain applications beyond contact tracing and vaccine certification is presented.},

Consequently, the chip hardware must be designed in an optimum fashion to meet this purpose; this includes the corresponding cryptographic procedures for securing the secret data. However, security is not only dependent on the specialised hardware of the microcontroller or on the cryptographic algorithms implemented in the operating system software. The security of applications for smart cards and the design principles applied by the developers to meet these security needs are of fundamental importance. The essential property of a smart card is its ability to offer a secure environment for data and programs. This article examines the range of possible attacks against smart cards, and the measures that can be used to protect against these attacks.},

	abstract = {Side-channel attacks on mobile devices have gained increasing attention since their introduction in 2007. While traditional side-channel attacks, such as power analysis attacks and electromagnetic analysis attacks, required physical presence of the attacker as well as expensive equipment, an (unprivileged) application is all it takes to exploit the leaking information on modern mobile devices. Given the vast amount of sensitive information that are stored on smartphones, the ramifications of side-channel attacks affect both the security and privacy of users and their devices. In this paper, we propose a new categorization system for side-channel attacks, which is necessary as side-channel attacks have evolved significantly since their scientific investigations during the smart card era in the 1990s. Our proposed classification system allows to analyze side-channel attacks systematically, and facilitates the development of novel countermeasures. Besides this new categorization system, the extensive survey of existing attacks and attack strategies provides valuable insights into the evolving field of side-channel attacks, especially when focusing on mobile devices. We conclude by discussing open issues and challenges in this context and outline possible future research directions.},

	doi = {10.1109/SP.2010.33},
	abstract = {EMV is the dominant protocol used for smart card payments worldwide, with over 730 million cards in circulation. Known to bank customers as “Chip and PIN”, it is used in Europe; it is being introduced in Canada; and there is pressure from banks to introduce it in the USA too. EMV secures credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the card and the customer presenting it through a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a protocol ﬂaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card to make a payment without knowing the card’s PIN, and to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online connection to the banking network. The fraudster performs a man-in-the-middle attack to trick the terminal into believing the PIN veriﬁed correctly, while telling the card that no PIN was entered at all. The paper considers how the ﬂaws arose, why they remained unknown despite EMV’s wide deployment for the best part of a decade, and how they might be ﬁxed. Because we have found and validated a practical attack against the core functionality of EMV, we conclude that the protocol is broken. This failure is signiﬁcant in the ﬁeld of protocol design, and also has important public policy implications, in light of growing reports of fraud on stolen EMV cards. Frequently, banks deny such fraud victims a refund, asserting that a card cannot be used without the correct PIN, and concluding that the customer must be grossly negligent or lying. Our attack can explain a number of these cases, and exposes the need for further research to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical security of bank payment systems. It also demonstrates the need for the next version of EMV to be engineered properly.},

Security of these applications depends upon the nature of underlying hardware and software platforms, cryptographic algorithms, along with a number of other security mechanisms. To develop a secure smart card–based application, preliminary evaluation of the security of embedded software as well as how that software will work in real time is required. Over the past few years, significant improvements have been made in smart card technology for its large-scale acceptance. However, attackers are in continuous search for exploiting the unknown issues related to this technology. This survey discusses smart card technology in detail and provides a comprehensive taxonomy of security attacks on smart card–based applications and their countermeasures. In addition, it covers some of the open source tools available for its development. Finally, it provides a brief outline of some of the major open challenges and future research directions that are yet to be explored.},

	abstract = {recent development emanating from RFID technology is Near Field Communication (NFC). Basically, NFC is a popular short range ({\textless} 10 cm) wireless communication technology with applications in areas sensitive to security and privacy concerns like contactless payment. Since NFC communications require very close proximity between two communicating devices (e.g., a smartcard and a terminal), it is generally believed that Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks are practically infeasible here. Contrasting this belief, in this paper, we successfully establish MITM attack in NFC communications between a passive tag and an active terminal. We carefully present physical fundamentals of the attack, our engineering design, and results of successful attack implementation. We then identify a potential vulnerability in existing contactless payment protocols due to separation between card authentication and transaction authorization phases. We then show in this paper, how an attacker can compromise the integrity of contactless payment using a malicious MITM smartcard, and also present multiple attack/victim scenarios to demonstrate practicality of our contributions. We also conduct rigorous experimental studies to analyze both hardware and practical ramifications of our attack. Finally, we propose a countermeasure to detect the MITM attack based on experimental analysis, that does not demand any additional hardware.},
